Not too far down the road from Yellow, young creature looked upward toward some very tall and beautiful purple and red flowers the size of swimming pool at the park.  "What
wonderful flowers," said young creature.  

There, in the center of one of the beautiful and colorful flowers, the young creature saw an amazing creature with very large and beautiful wings the size of a shower curtain.
They were bright yellow with wide black stripes all over them.
