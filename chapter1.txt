Once upon a moon of Jupiter, there lived a creature of magnificent proportions in relation to Earth-borne creatures.  Life was grand,
but the creature is very young.  He was known as the young oversized creature where all creatures of his kind are considered oversize.  The young 
oversized creature is always happy and his mother loves him very much.  

She reads to him every day about other creatures on the moon of Jupiter, called Moonglow.
