Soon, the young creature came upon an unusual being with long yellow arms and two huge eyes, the size of watermelons, with eyelids that were always half-way over the 
huge eyes like he was completely at ease with his life.  "Hello, yellow being.  I wonder if you could help me?" asked the young creature.

"I'm quite busy being comfortable with my life, right now, unusually large young creature.  What is it you desire?" asked the yellow creature in a very relaxed tone of voice.

"I want a name.  A wonderful name.  A name like no other.  A name that means something.  A name I can cherish forever," whispered the young creature, hoping it would not
 frighten his new friend.

"I see," said Yellow. "I quite understand your dilemma.  Without a name, you are never sure who is calling you for dinner or demanding your homework or giving you a 
gift," Yellow's eyes suddenly looked into the heavens of space as if he was in deep thought.  "On the other hand, having no name has its advantages as well....hmmm."

"Oh, please, Mr Yellow.  I want a name.  Do you have a good one for me?"  asked the over-sized young creature.
