As luck would have it, the creature didn't have a name.  His mother would simply speak to him without calling him by a name. The young creature
wanted one for his very own and decided to find a fantastic name for himself.  He immediately set out on a quest to find a wonderful name.  

After breakfast, the creature bid his mother good-bye, who was quite diligent in commanding him to come home for dinner.  He happily agreed, 
feeling his mother had indirectly given her consent for his wonderful adventure into the unknown of this particular abscure lumpy green moon of Jupiter.

"How exciting!" the young creature exclaimed in a loud voice for everyone to hear in the immediate hearing range of his voice (which was quite a loud voice, 
so almost half of the moon instantly became aware of his wonderful adventure).


About that time, a spaceship that looked like a flying saucer was flying close to the young creature.  The very loud sound the young creature's excited voice shook 
the flying saucer and it wobbled and wobbled and wobbled and finally crashed into the ground and damaged a landing strut.
